<h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/6508">Scientific Spaces Browsing Guide (FAQ)</a></h1>

<p>By 苏剑林 | March 26, 2019</p>

<p>In fact, besides writing blog content over the past few years, I have spent a considerable amount of time on the "surface work" of Scientific Spaces. To this end, I specifically learned a bit of PHP, CSS, and JS. While I wouldn't claim it's perfect, the overall browsing experience should be much better than in previous years.</p>

<p>Considering that some readers might need certain features but may not notice them immediately, I have organized some on-site tips here.</p>

<h2>Article Section</h2>

<h3>What is the best environment for reading articles?</h3>

<p>Two years ago, Scientific Spaces adopted a responsive design that automatically adapts to screens of different resolutions. Therefore, the text content should be clear regardless of the resolution. The only issue is that on small-screen mobile phones, formulas may be incomplete or misaligned. For a better experience reading formulas, it is best to use a screen larger than 7 inches. If you must use a small-screen phone, consider reading in landscape mode.</p>

<h3>Are there PDF versions of the articles? Can they be printed?</h3>

<p>Articles are not provided in PDF format, nor are $\LaTeX$ source files provided (because I don't have them; I write directly online).</p>

<p>If you need to print an article, simply go to the article page and look for the "Print" (打印) button near the title. After clicking "Print," most of the blog's irrelevant UI elements will be cleared, leaving only the main body of the article, allowing for a clean print onto paper.</p>

<p>If your computer has a PDF printer installed (like macOS which has it built-in), you can select "Print to PDF" in the print window. This is the method for saving articles as PDF files.</p>

<h3>How can I share articles with others?</h3>

<p>If you are willing to share articles from Scientific Spaces with others, the author would be extremely honored. A quick way to share is also via the "Share" (分享) button in the title bar. Of course, you can also manually copy and paste the link.</p>

<h3>How to repost or cite articles?</h3>

<p>This site uses the "<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/cn/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</a>" agreement. Reposting is not prohibited, but you must credit this site, provide a source link, and commercial use is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while reposting is allowed, for platforms with "Original" (原创) identifiers like WeChat Official Accounts, you must contact me privately and obtain authorization if you wish to repost an article from this site as "Original." Otherwise, I will do my best to pursue relevant responsibilities.</p>

<p>As a matter of basic respect, please do not simply "rewrite" (spun content) articles and publish them as your "original" work.</p>

<p>If you wish to cite a blog post in your work, that would also be my great honor. For a basic format, please click the "Cite" (引用) button in the title bar.</p>

<p>Of course, this is just a reference format. In fact, I don't know the standard format for citing web pages either; just use your best judgment—as long as you have the intention to cite, I am already very happy. A BibTeX format may be used as a reference:</p>

<p>Just replace the content accordingly.</p>

<h2>Search Section</h2>

<h3>Search Method 1: On-site Search</h3>

<p>The most basic method is to use the site's internal search. Enter the content you want to search for in the "Intelligent Search" (智能搜索) box on the right side of the site. It supports full-sentence input, automatically performs word segmentation, and extracts key information for ranking. Personally, I think it is quite an intelligent search. Note: On mobile devices, you need to click the button in the top right for it to appear.</p>

<h3>Search Method 2: Categories and Tags</h3>

<p>"Searching" is essentially a way to narrow down the reading range and better locate the information you need. Categories and tags can serve this purpose. Every article has its own category and tag information. Categories are divided by the author, and tags are manually extracted by the author, not machine-generated.</p>

<p>URL formats for categories and tags:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Information Age" Category: <a href="https://kexue.fm/category/Big-Data">https://kexue.fm/category/Big-Data</a><br>
    "Flow Model" Tag: <a href="https://kexue.fm/tag/%E6%B5%81%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/">https://kexue.fm/tag/流模型/</a>
</blockquote>

<h3>Search Method 3: Archive Page</h3>

<p>On the archive page, you can see a list of all articles on the site: <a href="https://kexue.fm/content.html">https://kexue.fm/content.html</a>. You might pick out something you like from there.</p>

<h3>Search Method 4: External Search Engines</h3>

<p>The disadvantage of the Method 1 internal search is that it cannot search through comment content. A more comprehensive search is to use existing search engines like Google, Baidu, or Bing. Simply type into their search box:</p>
<blockquote>
    site:kexue.fm Your Keywords<br>
    or<br>
    site:spaces.ac.cn Your Keywords
</blockquote>
<p>Due to historical reasons, this site uses dual domains; you can try both.</p>

<h2>Comment Section</h2>

<h3>How to comment on an article?</h3>

<p>You can comment at the bottom of every article. Particularly, clicking the "Preview Effect" (预览效果) button allows you to see how your comment looks, which is very helpful for inputting $\LaTeX$ mathematical formulas.</p>

<p>Note: The server response might occasionally be slow. After clicking "Submit Comment" (提交评论) once, please wait a moment. Do not rush to click a second time, otherwise the comment may be submitted multiple times (though that's fine; I will manually delete duplicate comments).</p>

<h3>How to discuss with other commenters?</h3>

<p>You can click "Reply to Comment" (回复评论) under the corresponding comment to reply to others in a nested fashion. However, nesting only supports up to 10 levels. If it exceeds 10 levels, the "Reply" button will no longer appear. In this case, you can cite someone else's comment by clicking on the comment number.</p>

<h3>Will commenting leak my information?</h3>

<p>Comments require a nickname and an email address; providing your personal home page URL is optional. The front end only displays your nickname and personal home page; it will not reveal your email. Therefore, it will not bring you any spam harassment.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Are there technical exchange groups?</h3>

<p>Of course. For the QQ group, please search for group number 67729435. For the WeChat group, please add the WeChat robot <code>spaces_ac_cn</code>.</p>

<p>Basic group rules: In principle, any content related to science and technology can be discussed. Beginners, experts, and recruiters are all welcome, but please do not post spam. Also, watch your words and deeds; if unnecessary, please help keep the group quiet.</p>

<h3>How can I provide feedback or "troll" you?</h3>

<p>Didn't I just mention the comment function? You can leave a message directly under this article.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>May you find good memories here at Scientific Spaces~</p>
