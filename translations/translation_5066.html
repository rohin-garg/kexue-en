    <p>Readers may have noticed that visiting Scientific Spaces has been somewhat unstable over the past few days. The reason is that I have been making significant adjustments to the website during this time.</p>

    <p>Although the scope of these adjustments is quite large, they might be difficult to notice from the surface, so I am recording them here as a memento. The main updates include:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1. <strong>Theme Optimization:</strong> The <code>geekg</code> theme used by this blog is actually quite old. Last year, I paid someone to perform the first major upgrade, which added responsive design. Over the past few days, I mainly focused on resolving some legacy issues with this theme, including fine adjustments to image display, margins, and typography.</p>
        
        <p>2. <strong>Internal Optimization:</strong> I have significantly reduced the use of plugins. Some basic functions (such as the site directory and archive pages) have been embedded directly into the theme. This reduces dependency on plugins and improves usability.</p>
        
        <p>3. <strong>Article Optimization:</strong> This was also a legacy issue. In the early days of writing, I was quite casual about formatting; HTML code and LaTeX formula code were often non-standard, resulting in poor display for older articles. Consequently, I did something quite crazy—I went through over 800 articles one by one! After more than two days of work, I have basically fixed most of the issues in the earlier posts.</p>
        
        <p>4. <strong>Domain Optimization:</strong> The website is now fully using HTTPS! The site is hosted on Alibaba Cloud, but Alibaba Cloud has its own self-righteous monitoring system that blocks some of my pages for no reason. To counter Alibaba Cloud's malicious blocking, I had to switch to HTTPS. Of course, this will not affect readers' normal access, as the jump to HTTPS is automatic. Currently, both domains <a href="https://spaces.ac.cn">spaces.ac.cn</a> and <a href="https://kexue.fm">kexue.fm</a> will automatically redirect to HTTPS.</p>
