<h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/6906">Open Sourcing a Version of the DGCNN Reading Comprehension QA Model (Keras Version)</a></h1>

<p>By 苏剑林 | August 20, 2019</p>

<p>
  Last year, I wrote <a href="translation_5409.html">"DGCNN: A CNN-based Reading Comprehension Question Answering Model"</a>, which introduced a simple pure convolutional question-answering model. At that time, it was implemented in TensorFlow and was not open-sourced. These past few days, I took some time to reproduce it using Keras and decided to open-source it.
</p>

<h2>Model Overview</h2>

<p>
  Regarding the basic introduction of DGCNN, I will not repeat it here. The model released here is not a simple repetition of the previous model but has some modifications. Here, I will only introduce the parts that have been changed.
</p>

<blockquote>
  1. The score of the model released here on the offline validation set is approximately 0.72 (previously it was approximately 0.75);<br><br>
  2. This model uses characters as the basic unit and utilizes the "<a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/6671#%E5%AD%97%E8%AF%8D%E6%B7%B7%E5%90%88Embedding">Mixed Character-Word Embedding</a>" explored by the author previously (previously it was word-based);<br><br>
  3. This model has completely removed manual features (previously 8 manual features were used);<br><br>
  4. This model has removed Position Embeddings (previously Position Embeddings were concatenated to the input);<br><br>
  5. The model architecture and training details have been slightly adjusted.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Among these, using characters as the unit is to make the model's labeling more flexible (avoiding word segmentation errors); removing manual features also enhances the model's flexibility and improves prediction speed; as for removing Position Embeddings, it is because several tests showed that Position Embeddings did not provide a significant improvement; other adjustments include using the latest <a href="https://github.com/bojone/keras_radam">RAdam optimizer</a> for training, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  This release did not meticulously pursue an increase in score; it was purely to introduce a Keras version for everyone's reference. I believe there is still plenty of room for improvement, and interested friends can debug it themselves (both code and datasets have been released).
