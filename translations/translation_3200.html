    <h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/3200">The Multiplicative Group of a Finite Prime Field is a Cyclic Group</a></h1>
    <p>By 苏剑林 | January 20, 2015</p>

    <p>For any prime number $p$, the set $\mathbb{Z}_p=\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}$ under addition and multiplication modulo $p$ forms a field. This is a fact known to any reader who has studied abstract algebra or elementary number theory. According to the definition of a field, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ must first be an abelian group under addition modulo $p$. Furthermore, due to the specific nature of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, it is also a cyclic group, which is a relatively trivial fact. However, what about multiplication?</p>

    <p>First, $0$ has no inverse, so we consider multiplication on the set $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p = \mathbb{Z}_p \setminus \{0\} = \{1,2,\dots,p-1\}$. If I say that <strong>$\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ also forms a cyclic group under multiplication modulo $p$</strong>, this conclusion is not quite so trivial! Yet it is indeed a fact, and it holds for all prime numbers $p$. With this fact, several results in number theory become quite obvious. For instance, when $d \mid (p-1)$, there are exactly $\frac{p-1}{d}$ $d$-th power residues in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, which is a fundamental conclusion regarding cyclic groups.</p>

    <p>In the book <i>Proofs from THE BOOK</i>, there is a proof of this conclusion, but that proof is existential. I have seen similar existential proofs in other books as well. In other words, it seems that popular proofs tend to be existential; they tell us that $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ is a cyclic group but do not tell us how to find its generator. In fact, Gauss provided a constructive proof in his <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i>. (In number theory, the conclusion of this article represents the fundamental knowledge in the chapter on "primitive roots.") Below, I will replicate Gauss's proof for the reader's reference.</p>

    <h3 id="constructive-procedure">Constructive Procedure</h3>

    <p>First, it should be trivial for readers understanding this article that $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ forms a finite group under multiplication modulo $p$; if not, please finish and familiarize yourself with that proof first. Since it is a finite group, every element has a finite order. We only need to find an element of order $p-1$ to prove that $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ is a cyclic group.</p>

    <p>The method is not overly complex. First, arbitrarily choose an element $a \in \mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$. Suppose its order is $\|a\|=r$, then $r \mid (p-1)$. If $r=p-1$, then the work is naturally finished. Otherwise, consider the equation $x^r=1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since $a$ is of order $r$, we have $a^r=1$, and consequently:
    $$1=1^r=a^r=(a^2)^r=\dots=(a^{r-1})^r=1$$
    The equation $x^r=1$ has at most $r$ distinct solutions in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and the expression above shows that $1, a, a^2, \dots, a^{r-1}$ are exactly its $r$ distinct solutions, and thus all of its solutions. This means that for every $d \mid r$, any element of order $d$ in $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ must be in the set $\{1, a, a^2, \dots, a^{r-1}\}$.</p>

    <p>Next, exclude these $r$ numbers from $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ and choose an element $b$ from the remaining elements. Suppose its order is $\|b\|=s$. If $s=p-1$, the task is complete. Otherwise, since the previous $r$ numbers have been excluded, $s \nmid r$. Consequently, the least common multiple $[r,s] > \max\{r,s\}$. Consider the element $ab$. Then $ab$ has an order related to $[a,b]$. [Note: If $\gcd(r,s)=1$, the order is exactly $rs$. In general, one can construct an element of order $\text{lcm}(r,s)$ from elements of order $r$ and $s$]. If we reach an element of order $p-1$, the task is finished; otherwise, following a method similar to the previous step, exclude:
    $$1, ab, (ab)^2, \dots, (ab)^{[a,b]-1}$$
    from $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$, find an arbitrary element $c$ from the remaining numbers, and repeat the process.</p>

    <p>Because each step allows us to find an element of higher order than the previous step, and each time we find an element of order $d$, we remove $d$ elements where $d < p-1$. That is to say, as long as an element of order $p-1$ has not been found, the procedure will not terminate. However, since the order has an upper bound of $p-1$, the procedure must terminate within a finite number of steps. Thus, an element of order $p-1$ must necessarily exist. Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}^\cdot_p$ is a cyclic group, and the above procedure helps us find the generator.</p>

    <h3 id="example-demonstration">Example Demonstration</h3>

    <p>Taking $p=79$ as an example, let us demonstrate how to find a generator for $\mathbb{Z}^*_{78}$ [Note: implying the group of order 78]. In the first step, choose $a=2$. It necessarily holds that:
    $$2^{78} \equiv 1 \pmod{79}$$
    Readers might say this is a conclusion of Fermat's Little Theorem, but from an algebraic perspective, it is a necessary conclusion of a finite group given that $\mathbb{Z}^*_{78}$ is a group. Now check $2^{39}$; we find $2^{39} \equiv 1 \pmod{79}$. Then check $2^3$ and $2^{13}$, finding neither is congruent to 1 modulo 79. Thus $\|2\|=39$. Calculate:
    $$2^0, 2^1, \dots, 2^{38} \pmod{79}$$
    This yields:</p>

    <blockquote>
    1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 49, 19, 38, 76, 73, 67, 55, 31, 62, 45, 11, 22, 44, 9, 18, 36, 72, 65, 51, 23, 46, 13, 26, 52, 25, 50, 21, 42, 5, 10, 20, 40
    </blockquote>

    <p>We find that $3$ is not in this list, so we choose $b=3$. Without further checking, one can immediately judge that $6=3 \times 2$ must be an element of order 78 (because the order in each step is higher than before, and the only order higher than 39 can only be 78). Therefore, $6$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}^*_{78}$.</p>
