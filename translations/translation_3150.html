    <h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/3150">Decomposing a Polynomial into the Sum of Two Irreducible Polynomials</a></h1>
    <p>By 苏剑林 | December 22, 2014</p>

    <p>In the chapter on polynomials in Advanced Algebra, there is usually an exercise that goes like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Prove that any polynomial over the field of rational numbers can be expressed as the sum of two irreducible polynomials over the field of rational numbers.
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a simple exercise, and there are several ways to prove it. First, let's introduce an ingenious proof.</p>

    <h2>An Ingenious Proof</h2>
    <p>Polynomial problems over the <strong>rational field</strong> are equivalent to polynomial problems over the <strong>integer ring</strong>. Therefore, we only need to prove it for polynomials over the integer ring (this conversion allows us to use Eisenstein's Criterion). Let $f(x)$ be an $n$-th degree polynomial over the <strong>integer ring</strong>:</p>
    $$f(x)=a_n x^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1 x+a_0$$
    <p>We only need to notice that</p>
    $$p f(x)=\left[p f(x)+x^n+p\right]-(x^{n}+p)$$
    <p>where $p$ is a prime number. Then $x^n+p$ is an irreducible polynomial over the integer ring. Thus, we only need to consider $p f(x)+x^n+p$. The highest-degree term of this polynomial is $(pa_n +1)x^n$, and all other terms are potentially divisible by $p$. According to Eisenstein's Criterion, we just need to find a $p$ such that $p^2$ does not divide the constant term. The constant term is $p a_0+p$. If $p^2 \mid p a_0+p$, then $p \mid a_0+1$, meaning $a_0+1$ is a multiple of $p$. However, $a_0+1$ cannot be divisible by every prime number. Therefore, we can always find a prime $p$ such that $p \nmid a_0+1$, which implies $p^2 \nmid (pa_0+p) = \text{constant term}$. Thus, by Eisenstein's Criterion, $p f(x)+x^n+p$ is an irreducible polynomial over the integer ring. Consequently, $f(x)$ has the decomposition:</p>
    $$f(x)=\left[f(x)+\frac{1}{p} x^n+1\right]+\left[-\frac{1}{p}(x^n +p)\right]$$
    <p>The terms in the square brackets are irreducible polynomials over the <strong>rational field</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Erroneous Process</h2>
    <p><strong>The following content is basically incorrect!!</strong></p>
    <p>In fact, the aforementioned proposition can be extended:</p>
    <blockquote>
        1. Any polynomial over the real field can be expressed as the sum of two irreducible polynomials over the real field. (This is actually NOT true!!)
        <br><br>
        2. Any polynomial over the rational field can be expressed as the sum of two irreducible polynomials over the rational field, where the degrees of the two irreducible polynomials do not exceed the degree of the original polynomial.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Below, based on a line of reasoning I conceived, I will prove the two conclusions above respectively.</p>

    <h3>Generic Simple Proof</h3>
    <p><strong>Extension 1</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        Any polynomial over the <strong>real field</strong> can be expressed as the sum of two irreducible polynomials over the real field. (This is actually NOT true!!)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial over the <strong>real field</strong>:</p>
    $$f(x)=a_n x^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1 x+a_0$$
    <p>Then</p>
    $$f(x)=\left(x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}\right)-\left(x^{2n}+2q^{2n}\right)$$
    <p>When $q > 0$, $x^{2n}+2q^{2n}=0$ obviously has no roots in the real field, making it an irreducible polynomial over the real field. Meanwhile, $x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}$ is a polynomial with $x^{2n}$ as the leading term (even degree), so $x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}$ has a lower bound. Therefore, when $q$ is sufficiently large, $x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}$ is always greater than 0, meaning $x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}=0$ can also have no roots in the real field. In this case, $x^{2n}+f(x)+2q^{2n}$ is an irreducible polynomial over the real field. Thus, the proposition is proven.</p>

    <p><strong>Extension 2</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        Any polynomial over the <strong>rational field</strong> can be expressed as the sum of two irreducible polynomials over the rational field, where the degrees of the two irreducible polynomials do not exceed the degree of the original polynomial.
    </blockquote>
    <p>This proposition was already proven in the ingenious proof at the beginning of the article. Now, based on the logic used in "Extension 1", I provide another proof for Extension 2. The proof for "Extension 1" cannot be used directly because it relies on adding a higher-degree term, which violates the condition that the degrees must not exceed the original degree. In fact, "Extension 2" does not hold in the real field.</p>
    <p>Let $f(x)$ be a monic polynomial over the <strong>integer ring</strong>:</p>
    $$f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1 x+a_0$$
    <p>Discuss by cases:</p>
    <p>1. When $n$ is even, $f(x)$ has a lower bound in the real field. Thus, for a sufficiently large integer $q$, $f(x)+q$ is always greater than 0. Therefore, $f(x)+q=0$ has no roots in the real field, making it irreducible over the real field and also over the integer ring. Thus, $f(x)$ has the decomposition:</p>
    $$f(x)=\left[f(x)+q\right]-q$$
    <p>$-q$ is also an irreducible polynomial over the integer ring.</p>
    <p>2. When $n$ is odd, first assume $a_{n-1} \neq 0$. In this case, consider:</p>
    $$f(x)=\left[f(x)-x^n+ 2q^n\right]+(x^n-2 q^n)$$
    <p>When $q$ is an integer, $x^n-2 q^n$ is an irreducible polynomial over the integer ring (no rational roots). So we only need to consider $f(x)-x^n+ 2q^n$. It is a polynomial of degree $n-1$ (even degree). If $a_{n-1} > 0$, it has a lower bound in the real field, so for a sufficiently large $q$, it is always greater than 0 and thus irreducible over the real field. If $a_{n-1} < 0$, it has an upper bound in the real field, so for a sufficiently small $q$, it is always less than 0 and irreducible over the real field. Thus, this case is proven.</p>
    <p>3. When $n$ is odd and $a_{n-1}=0$, consider:</p>
    $$f(x)=\left[f(x)-x^n+2x^{n-1}+2(2q+1)\right]+\left[x^n-2x^{n-1}-2(2q+1)\right]$$
    <p>By Eisenstein's Criterion, for any integer $q$, $x^n-2x^{n-1}-2(2q+1)$ is irreducible over the integer ring. We then only need to consider $f(x)-x^n+2x^{n-1}+2(2q+1)$, which is an $(n-1)$-th degree (even degree) polynomial. Its leading term is $2x^{n-1}$, so it has a lower bound in the real field. Thus, for a sufficiently large $q$, it is always greater than 0 and irreducible over the real field. This case is also proven.</p>

    <h3>Summary of Thinking</h3>
    <p>Most of the reasoning in this article is simple: try to construct an even-degree polynomial with a free constant term, so that for a sufficiently large (or small) constant, it can always be greater than 0, making it irreducible over the real field and thus irreducible over the rationals. The other part is a polynomial that is obviously irreducible, thereby completing the proof.</p>
