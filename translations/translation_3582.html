    <p>The solution manual for the exercises in <i>Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals</i> has finally progressed to version 0.4. At present, the exercises for the first seven chapters have been basically completed.</p>

    <p>Today is already January 9, 2016. 2015 has passed, and I forgot to wish everyone a Happy New Year. I am truly sorry. Let me add it here: <strong>I wish everyone a Happy New Year and may everything go as you wish!</strong></p>

    <p>I am now a senior in college, approaching final exams and graduation. I have been very busy lately with many things. One of them is that I joined the startup team of a small internet company, where I am responsible for text mining and occasionally writing web crawlers, among other things. I feel that since joining, I have gained a lot of experience and technical knowledge, reaching a new level compared to my last internship. Right now, there are several tasks lined up, and I am busy in a fulfilling way. Additionally, I have started writing my graduation thesis. Finishing it early will give me more time to study the things I love. My thesis is on topics related to path integrals; I feel that I am writing it quite clearly and understandably. When the time is right, I will publish it to help popularize path integrals ^_^. Furthermore, doing a few path integral exercises every day consumes a lot of time; for some difficult problems, it takes several mornings just to write a relatively satisfactory solution. I always feel like there are so many things I want to learn and do, but so little time.</p>

    <p>Here, I will simply say: "Keep going, keep going, keep going!" as a mutual encouragement for us all. You are welcome to continue supporting Scientific Spaces, and I will keep updating.</p>

    <p>That's all for now, here is the file: <a href="https://kexue.fm/usr/uploads/2016/01/2020361011.pdf">Solutions to Exercises of "Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals" V0.4.pdf</a></p>

    <p>Next, I might work on Chapter 8 regarding the harmonic oscillator, or Chapter 10 regarding statistical mechanics. In fact, Chapter 10 is closer to the previous content, such as the perturbation theory in Chapter 6. Moreover, Chapter 10 involves path integrals of real variables, which are actually easier to understand or more practical. Please look forward to it. Readers are also welcome to identify any errors in the exercise solutions.</p>
