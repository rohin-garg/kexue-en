<h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/4164">Happy 2017! Responsive Geekg for Typecho</a></h1>

<p>By 苏剑林 | December 31, 2016</p>

<p><strong>2016 is about to draw to a close. Here, I wish all readers a Happy 2017 and a smooth and prosperous New Year!</strong></p>

<p>As the saying goes, "New Year, new look," and Scientific Spaces has also put on a new coat. Wait, you don't feel much of a change? Don't worry, please read on.</p>

<p>Let's talk about some history first. Scientific Spaces started in March 2009. A major reason I fell in love with blogging back then was the theme I am currently using, originally created by <a href="http://www.geekg.com/">geekg.com</a>. The color scheme of this theme is very classic and immediately attracted me. Of course, it wasn't just me; at that time, various blogging platforms and even CMS portal platforms, including WordPress, PJBlog, etc., all imitated this theme, which shows its classic appeal. Later, someone ported this theme to Typecho, which led me to switch to Typecho—firstly because of Typecho's lightness and efficiency, and secondly because of the existence of this classic theme.</p>

<p>Since 2009, I have consistently used this theme. In the past two years, I briefly switched to other themes, but eventually, I returned to this one. Over these seven years, front-end technology has continued to evolve; HTML5, responsive design, and so on have become mainstream. I have always wanted to upgrade this theme, but unfortunately, I know nothing about front-end development. Recently, I invited a front-end expert to help, and after about two weeks, we finally completed the upgrade of this theme.</p>

<p><strong>What has changed? If you are viewing this in a desktop browser, you might not notice much of a difference. However, try resizing your browser window, and you will see. The most obvious point is the addition of responsive design, which can automatically adapt to browsers with different resolutions. Now, you can also comfortably read this Space using tablets, mobile phones, and other device browsers. Of course, for articles containing a large number of formulas, it is still recommended to use a widescreen for the best viewing effect.</strong></p>

<p>If you visit this blog frequently, you might encounter issues like layout misalignments when visiting now; that is due to browser caching. You simply need to clear your browser cache.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I've made several adjustments, such as optimizing the blog post list, adding comment pagination, and beautifying the table of contents within articles. The theme hasn't undergone extensive testing, so if you encounter any problems, I hope you can provide feedback. I look forward to your continued support~ Feel free to share your valuable ideas.</p>
