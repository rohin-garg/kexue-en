  <h1><a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/7782">The 1,000th Article</a></h1>
  <p>By 苏剑林 | September 29, 2020</p>

  <blockquote>
    The backend indicates that this is the 1,000th article on Scientific Spaces.
  </blockquote>

  <p>I originally intended to write the next serious article, but seeing this prompt, I’ll first write a casual "filler" post to commemorate it. They say as people get older, they like to get sentimental over everything, and it seems that’s true. Seeing others write reflections on the college entrance exam, writing a reflection for a blog's tenth anniversary, and now writing one for the 1,000th article—it’s as if I’m always looking for a reason to be nostalgic. So, what can I ramble about today?</p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://kexue.fm/usr/uploads/2020/09/4095555287.png" title="Click to view original image">
      <img src="https://kexue.fm/usr/uploads/2020/09/4095555287.png" alt="1000" />
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>First, a bit of narcissism. One thousand articles—if they were printed out, even at one page per article, that would be a 1,000-page book. I believe many people have never even held a 1,000-page book (though I actually have read one, as evidenced in my post: <a href="translation_2008.html">"Haha, my 'Bible' has arrived"</a>). To think I’ve actually written 1,000 posts—I’m quite impressed with myself. Of course, some of the early articles were reposts and not entirely my own writing, but I’ve stuck with a lot of original content. Even the reposted ones were edited and organized by me rather than just being a pure copy-paste, so it’s somewhat justifiable.</p>

  <p>Then, a moment of gratitude for my luck. The blog originally focused on astronomy and popular science, then gradually drifted toward theoretical physics and mathematics, and now leans toward machine learning. Regardless, I am very fortunate to have persisted on this path of science. Although I didn't become a "true" natural scientist or mathematician as I had imagined in my childhood, I am at least in a related field. In my spare time, I can still perform scientific calculations, which is enough to honor my original dream.</p>

  <p>Actually, I started out messing with operating systems. That was in 7th grade, when I first encountered computers. I was curious about everything and accidentally stumbled into an IT forum where I learned about OS "packaging" (creating custom distributions). Then I accidentally started my own forum to release my works and kept doing that until 9th grade (<a href="translation_531.html">"Three Years, Two Years, One Year..."</a>, <a href="translation_2726.html">"[Tracing Back] Legendary Figure of the Packaging Industry"</a>). Later, by some stroke of luck or realization, I suddenly "woke up" and decided to return to natural science, which led to the creation of Scientific Spaces.</p>

  <p>Thus, the birth of Scientific Spaces is, in itself, something worth celebrating for me because it signifies my return to the "right track."</p>

  <p>Finally, some thanks. To follow "routine protocol," I want to thank everyone for your support and encouragement, and thank the early <a href="http://cosmostation.lamost.org/website/">"Cosmos Station"</a> for providing server space, and so on. Scientific Spaces is, after all, a personal blog primarily for "taking notes" and is not a dedicated server service. Therefore, it is difficult to satisfy every reader's needs simultaneously. For that, I also thank my readers for being "lenient," which has allowed Scientific Spaces to receive a certain amount of positive feedback.</p>

  <p>I originally wanted to say, like in <a href="translation_6469.html">"Happy Pi Day! || I've actually been blogging for ten years~"</a>, that I look forward to the next 1,000 articles. But after doing the math, even if I maintain my current update frequency, the next 1,000 posts would be 20 years from now. Who can say for sure where we'll be in 20 years?</p>

  <p>Last but not least, I wish everyone a happy Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day~</p>
