<p>I like eating food, but I usually eat with an appreciative eye; I'm not exactly the hardcore "foodie" type. What I enjoy more is making food, witnessing the magnificent transformation of ingredients "from the market to the dinner table." I believe this is an essential part of life.</p>

Garlic Steamed Shrimp - The Story of Scallions
</p>

<p>I believe many readers have had such thoughts: we once wanted to be like the protagonists of wuxia novels, "traveling the four seas, undefeated under heaven," or "creating our own martial arts, becoming a master in our own right." Although real life no longer allows us to be so unrestrained, I feel I can find the same sensation in the kitchen. My culinary skills are not high; I just want to say that in the kitchen, you find that sense of creation that comes naturally. You will be intoxicated by it—intoxicated by the process of processing fresh ingredients into delicious dishes.</p>

<p>By extension, you might even fall in love with visiting wet markets, because that is the source of ingredients and the place with the most "flavor of life."</p>

<p>Gu Long once wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
If a person is driven to a dead end and feels so narrow-minded that they want to commit suicide, send them to the wet market.
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I don't know Gu Long well, and I haven't read his novels (on the other hand, I've read all of Jin Yong's novels several times, and some of them more than a dozen times). But when I occasionally saw this sentence from Gu Long, I agreed with it from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>Whether it is the kitchen or the wet market, both are part of life (the martial arts world). Gu Long even directly wrote this perspective into his wuxia novels. There is a segment in his <i>The Sentimental Swordsman, Ruthless Sword</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
Tie Chuanjia, who was at his wit's end, unintentionally walked into the wet market. Women holding children, old ladies with canes, chefs covered in grease—all kinds of people squeezed past him with vegetable baskets, arguing over a single penny with the village women selling vegetables and the butchers selling meat, vivid and lively. His mood suddenly cleared up.
</blockquote>

<p>No wonder more and more young people are committing suicide nowadays; it's because the number of times they visit the wet market is decreasing~</p>
